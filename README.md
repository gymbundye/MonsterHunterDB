# MonsterHunterDB

Capstone Project for Code Ky


My Capstone project is "Monster HunterDB". It is a Crud Api of Monster Data. A user can look at our Data and see what type 
of Monsters that are known and then look at our weakness page to see how to defeat them. My application is made with C#
Blazor Pages and uses EF Core to handle Sqlite connections. Afterwards I added a bit of my own styling. Thank you so much for checking 
out Monster Hunter DB!

Below is a list of the features that I incorporated into my project.

1.  I made an Api. My monster data is an Api of monster information.
2.  My application is a CRUD api. You can create, read, update and delete monster info.
3.  My application is asynchronous. It awaits you to click add a monster before loading the page.
4.  Monster Hunter DB uses a generic class of  type MONSTER.
5.  I have commented examples of SOLID. you will find them at index.razor.cs line 7 and Nav.Menu.razor line 40

How to Run the Project:

1. Ensure that you have Microsoft Visual Studio Installed. Here is a link to download if you need it.
Just copy and paste it in your browser and then follow the steps for instilation.
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/

2. Go to my Github Repository for this project: https://github.com/gymbundye/MonsterHunterDB
Once there click on the button that says code. Here you have two options. You can either open the project with
visual studio from here or clone the solution by copying and pasting the repository link into the visual studio itself.

3. Once the solution is loaded you should be able to press the play button where it says https.....However sometimes you
have to go up to the top of Microsoft VS and click on View. Then Click on Solution Explorer. Inside the Solution Explorer, at the 
top,  will be a button with the purple Microsoft VS logo on it. This changes between folder and solution views. Make sure you are 
in MonsterHunterDB.Solution and then that play button should be there. Click it.

4. Have the greatest time of your life.
